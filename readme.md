comments 

ormconfig.json was not added because it has plian data 

comments in controller was left to check which practice is better  

there's conflict in the seeding and connection  to the data base , in case i want to seed i have to comment out the connection call in connect to DB method in server.ts 

## movieController 
sort & pagination was set by defult , Or it's better have them in their own class and call them dynamiclly
